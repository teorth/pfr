\begin{definition}[Additive energy]\label{energy-def}\lean{Finset.additiveEnergy}\leanok  If $G$ is a group, and $A$ is a finite subset of $G$, the \emph{additive energy} $E(A)$ of $A$ is the number of quadruples $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4) \in A^4$ such that $a_1+a_2 = a_3+a_4$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Cauchy--Schwarz bound]\label{cs-bound}\uses{energy-def}\lean{cauchy_schwarz}\leanok  If $G$ is a group, $A,B$ are finite subsets of $G$, then
$$ E(A) \geq \frac{|\{ (a,a') \in A \times A: a+a' \in B \}|^2}{|B|}.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\leanok  If $B$ is empty then the claim is trivial (with the Lean convention $0/0$), so without loss of generality $B$ is non-empty.  We can rewrite
$$ |\{ (a,a') \in A \times A: a+a' \in B \}| = \sum_{b \in B} r(b)$$
where $r: G \to \N$ is the counting function
$$ r(b) := |\{ (a,a') \in A \times A: a+a' = b \}|.$$
From double counting we have
$$ \sum_{b \in G} r(b)^2 = E(A).$$
The claim now follows from the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality
$$ (\sum_{b \in B} r(b))^2 \leq |B| \sum_{b \in B} r(b)^2.$$
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers lemma]\label{bsg}\uses{energy-def}\lean{bsg}\leanok Let $G$ be an abelian group, and let $A$ be a finite non-empty set with $E(A) \geq |A|^3 / K$ for some $K \geq 1$.  Then there is a subset $A'$ of $A$ with $|A'| \geq |A| / (C_1 K^{C_2})$ and $|A'-A'| \leq C_3 K^{C_4} |A|$, where (provisionally)
$$ C_1 = 2^4, C_2 = 1, C_3 = 2^{10}, C_4 = 5.$$

\begin{theorem}[Approximate homomorphism form of PFR]\label{approx-hom-pfr}\lean{approx_hom_pfr}\leanok Let $G,G'$ be finite abelian $2$-groups.
  Let $f: G \to G'$ be a function, and suppose that there are at least $|G|^2 / K$ pairs $(x,y) \in G^2$ such that
$$ f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y).$$
Then there exists a homomorphism $\phi: G \to G'$ and a constant $c \in G'$
such that $f(x) = \phi(x)+c$ for at least $|G| / (2 ^ {144} * K ^ {122})$
values of $x \in G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}\uses{goursat, cs-bound, bsg, pfr_aux-improv}\leanok Consider the graph $A \subset G \times G'$ defined by
$$ A := \{ (x,f(x)): x \in G \}.$$
Clearly, $|A| = |G|$.  By hypothesis, we have $a+a' \in A$ for at least
$|A|^2/K$ pairs $(a,a') \in A^2$. By \Cref{cs-bound}, this implies that $E(A)
\geq |A|^3/K^2$.  Applying \Cref{bsg}, we conclude that there exists a subset
$A' \subset A$ with $|A'| \geq |A|/C_1 K^{2C_2}$ and $|A'+A'| \leq C_1C_3
K^{2(C_2+C_4)} |A'|$. Applying \Cref{pfr-9-aux'}, we may find a subspace $H
\subset G \times G'$ such that $|H| / |A'| \in [L^{-8}, L^{8}]$ and a subset
$c$ of cardinality at most $L^5 |A'|^{1/2} / |H|^{1/2}$ such that $A'
\subseteq c + H$, where $L =  C_1C_3 K^{2(C_2+C_4)}$. If we let $H_0,H_1$ be
as in \Cref{goursat}, this implies on taking projections the projection of
$A'$ to $G$ is covered by at most $|c|$ translates of $H_0$.  This implies
that
$$ |c| |H_0| \geq |A'|;$$
since $|H_0| |H_1| = |H|$, we conclude that
$$ |H_1| \leq |c| |H|/|A'|.$$

By hypothesis, $A'$ is covered by at most $|c|$ translates of $H$, and hence
by at most $|c| |H_1|$ translates of $\{ (x,\phi(x)): x \in G \}$.  As $\phi$
is a homomorphism, each such translate can be written in the form $\{
(x,\phi(x)+c): x \in G \}$ for some $c \in G'$. The number of translates is
bounded by
$$
|c|^2 \frac{|H|}{|A'|} \leq \left(L^5 \frac{|A'|^{1/2}}{|H|^{1/2}}\right)^2 \frac{|H|}{|A'|} = L^{10}.
$$

By the pigeonhole principle, one of these translates must then contain at
least $|A'|/L^{10} \geq |G| / (C_1C_3 K^{2(C_2+C_4)})^{10} (C_1 K^{2C_2})$
elements of $A'$ (and hence of $A$), and the claim follows.
\end{proof}
