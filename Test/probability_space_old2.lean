/-- In this project, a ProbabilitySpace is modeled by a MeasureSpace with a finite volume measure
that can potentially vanish.  The probability measure is then the normalization of this probability
measure, bearing in mind that it may be zero. Thus we also consider a measure space with the zero
measure to be a (degenerate) example of a   This will be convenient when we wish to
condition the probability space to an event, because the event may potentially have zero measure. -/
